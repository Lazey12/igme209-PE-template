### [PE1](PE1/) - GIT - done

### [PE2](PE2/) - Hello World - this is done, itsjust an empty consol app pproject of c++

### [PE3](PE3/) - Functions - this is complete, its basically testing the functions of c++, nothing too big

### [PE4](PE4/) - Strings - this is done, this is the basic testing fo the string functions with also the if statements, for loops and arraying those strings

### [PE5](PE5/) - Debugging - so mycourses said i was done with PE5, but I just realised that I need to do it right now, basically this rolls a random number on a seed then it does the reverse word inputs

### [PE6](PE6/) - Pointers -  it is done, so this is the testing grounds for the storing of data with pointers and original, used by myInteger and myIntegerPointer

### [PE7](PE7/) - More Pointers - it is done, the createStackArray returns the garbage values as it returns the pointer to local stack array that is destroyed or deleted, after it ends.

### [PE8](PE8/) - Classes	Numeric - it is done, the array uses -1 as a terminating value instead of passing its length to functions, which is basically the nullptr, but in numeric form! all the numebrs are random!
